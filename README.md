# Gender and Age Distribution Visualization

This project visualizes the distribution of gender and age using bar charts and histograms. The visualizations are created using Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
Code Explanation
Data Preparation
Categorical Data: A DataFrame named data is created to hold gender categories and their corresponding counts.
Continuous Data: A Series named ages is created to represent age values.
Visualizations
Bar Chart for Gender Distribution
A bar chart is generated to show the distribution of gender categories (Male, Female, Other).
The x-axis represents the gender, and the y-axis represents the count of individuals.
Histogram for Age Distribution
A histogram is created to illustrate the distribution of ages within a specified range.
The x-axis represents age groups, and the y-axis represents the frequency of individuals within those groups.
How to Run
